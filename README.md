# 🧰 C++ OpenCV Toolbox

A growing collection of powerful, hands-on OpenCV examples in modern C++.  
This toolbox covers the building blocks of computer vision — from simple image manipulation to real-time detection tasks.

## ✨ Features

Each mini-project is self-contained and demonstrates a key concept of computer vision:

| Project                     | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| 📷 **Image Display**       | Load and show images using OpenCV's basic GUI |
| 🔍 **Image Resizing**      | Resize images while maintaining aspect ratios |
| ✂️ **Image Cropping**      | Extract regions of interest from images |
| 🖍 **Annotating**          | Draw shapes and text for image labeling |
| 📐 **Warp Perspective**    | Transform angled views into top-down perspectives |
| 🎨 **Color Detection (Image)** | Detect specific colors in still images using HSV filtering |
| 📹 **Color Detection (Video)** | Real-time color detection from webcam or video feed |
| 🧱 **Contour Mapping**     | Detect and outline shapes using contours |
| 😀 **Face Detection**      | Real-time face detection using Haar cascades |
| 🧾 **Document Scanner**    | Detect and straighten a document from a camera frame |
| 🖌 **Virtual Paint**       | Track color objects to "paint" on a virtual canvas |
| 🚗 **License Plate Detection** | Identify and isolate vehicle license plates |
